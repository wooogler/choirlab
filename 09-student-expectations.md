# Vacation Policy
- Our organization provides all students with 10 business days of vacation per year.
# Ph.D. Student Work Ethics
- Ph.D. students are not bound by a strict number of working hours; instead, they should focus on making good progress towards publishing their work while maintaining a balance between work and life. Research is considered the primary responsibility, and students must manage their time effectively to accommodate other tasks such as teaching, mentoring, and coursework.
